1.- Create a numeric vector that contains the months of a year. Then, create another vector containing the name for each month. Later,  you should assign the months and names. Finally, you should  select and display the months related to the summer season (June, July, August)

2.- Construct a matrix with 5 rows containing the numbers 1 up to 15, filled row-wise.

3.-Create a factor with these observations "XXL", "XXL", "XXL", "XL", "L", "M", "M", "S", "S", "S"  and print a summary

4.- Create and print a data frame that should contain:
  - 5 of your courses (e.g. Fundamentals of Programming, Object-Oriented Programming, Databases, etc ).
- 5 of your marks
- 5 of your professors' names


5.- Load the dataset labeled as **ITU_WB.csv** that is located in the **data** folder and storage this dataset in a variable called **itu**.   Then, you should describe the composition of the dataset. This description must contain the number of  observations, variables and the type of each variable


6.- Filter the **itu** dataset to retrieve only the observation from Mexico, grouped by year and  in descending order selecting the  "Internet value" column


7.- Create a new variable called **itu_by_year** grouping per "year"  and "Income group" variables. Then, remove  NAs observations. Later, using the function summarize() you should  estimate the median  of the `Internet value` variable and store it in a variable called "medianValue"


8.-Create a line plot to visualize trends over time. You should use the variables created in the **itu_by_year** dataset


9.- Create a new variable called **itu_latin** filtering per Region,  selecting Latin America & Caribbean and grouping per Income group. 

Then, using this dataset, create a plot visualizing the relationship between Internet value and GDP (US$)  colored per Income group and faceting per Economy


10.- Create a new variable called **itu_2017** filtering the year 2017 and removing observations that contain NAs. 

Then, using this dataset, create a plot visualizing the relationship between Internet value and GDP (US$),  colored per Income group. Furthermore,  you should use a log scale in both axes ("x" and "y"). Finally, you should use the facet function in order to wrap by Region.

Good luck and happy coding!!
